# python-class-
This repository is for the python which I did in my 3rd semester.
Here in this repo,  multiple codes are written and files are saved date wisely
(Due to multiple codes in 1 file which make difficult to write the name in a particular format.. )
These are all small codes practiced in my college. 
Pardon me in case you find any error.
